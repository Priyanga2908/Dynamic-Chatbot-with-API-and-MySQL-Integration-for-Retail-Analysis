# Dynamic Chatbot with API and MySQL Integration for Retail Analysis

This project is a comprehensive application that combines a React frontend with a Node.js backend and a MySQL database. It features a customer support chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to handle queries, interact with a MySQL database, and provide human-like responses.

 ## Project Overview

The Chatbot project is designed to provide a dynamic customer support solution for retail analytics. The chatbot can answer user queries about products, sales, and other relevant data from a MySQL database. It also logs user interactions and provides responses generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.

## Technologies
Language: JavaScript
Frontend Framework: React
Backend Framework: Node.js
Database: MySQL
AI Model: OpenAI GPT-3.5 turbo
Logging: Morgan
Error Handling: Custom middleware
Environment Configuration: dotenv

## Prerequisites

Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.
MySQL: Ensure MySQL is installed and running. Configure your database settings in the .env file.
React.js: Ensure you have a React development environment set up. You can follow the React documentation for setup instructions.
Git: Used for version control. Download and install from git-scm.com.

## Installation

Clone the Repository : 
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Retail-chatbot

Install Dependencies : 
Navigate to both the frontend and backend directories to install the necessary dependencies.

cd frontend
npm install

cd backend
npm install

Set Up Environment Variables : 
Create a .env file in the backend directory and configure your environment variables. Ensure you include necessary settings such as database credentials and OpenAI API keys. 

Database Setup:
1. Products(ProductID, Name, Description, Price, Category)
2. Customers(CustomerID, Name, Email)
3. Sales(SaleID, SaleDate, Amount, ProductID, CustomerID)
4. CustomerQueries(QueryID, CustomerID, QueryText, QueryDate)

These are the tables I have created . And you can customize it based on your Requirements.

##

## Running the Application
Start the Frontend Server : 
Navigate to the frontend directory and start the React development server:
cd frontend
npm start
This will open the application in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

Start the Backend Server : 
Open a new terminal window, navigate to the backend directory, and start the Node.js server:
cd backend
node index.js
This will start the server on port 5000

## Functionality
Frontend: Users interact with a chatbot interface. The chatbot sends queries to the backend, which processes them using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and returns human-like responses.
Backend: Receives queries from the frontend, generates SQL queries using GPT-3.5, executes them against the MySQL database, and sends the results back to the frontend.
Database: Stores product, customer, and sales information. Logs user messages and chatbot responses in the CustomerQueries table.

## Future Enhancements
Implement advanced analytics and reporting features.
Enhance the model to handle complex queries and interpret more nuanced human language.
Improve response formatting to ensure more coherent and user-friendly outputs.
Enhance Address fetch request errors to prevent overuse issues.

 ## Deployment
As of now, the project has not been deployed to any production environment. Future deployment can be done on platforms like Heroku or AWS.

## Notes

Ensure you have set up all required environment variables before running the project.
This is a basic implementation and can be extended with more features and customizations as needed.

Enjoy !
